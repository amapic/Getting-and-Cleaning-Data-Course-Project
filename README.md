Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
========================================
Hi, thanks for evaluating. Excuse my english !

All the code is in the run_analysis.R file.

The code is designed to work with all the file X_test.txt,X_train.txt,y_test.txt,y_train.txt,features.txt,subject_train.txt,subject_test.txt situated in the working directory.

The result of the point 5 is the variable EachActivitySubjectMean.
The result of the point 1,2,3,4 is the variable datafinal.
I didn't keep the feature variables containing meanFreq.
The means calculated for the last point works with each couple of Activity and Subject.
